# matlab-noaa-satellites
A MATLAB scenario visualizing the NOAA 15, 18, and 19 satellites in orbit around the Earth, based on their actual TLEs.
The code can be adjusted for any satellite with TLE. Every 24 hours the current TLEs are fetched from Celestrak and are saved in a text file. The TLEs are used to generate the orbit visualization of the satellites.
